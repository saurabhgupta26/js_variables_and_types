1. ðŸŽ– Write a program to calculate the total price of your phone purchase. With these conditions
 * [ ] You will keep purchasing phones (hint: loop!) until you run out of bank balance.
 * [ ] You'll also buy accessories for each phone as long as your purchase amount is below your spending threshold.
 * [ ] After you've calculated your purchase amount, add in the tax, then print out the calculated purchase amount, properly formatted.
 * [ ] Finally, check the amount against your bank account balance to see if you can afford it or not.
 * [ ] Write a function called calculateTax which takes an argument 'amount' and calculates the tax you need to pay.
 * [ ] Write a function named formatAmount which returns you amount in this format '$ 132.45' make the decimal fixed to 2 places.
```js
const SPENDING_THRESHOLD = 200;
const TAX_RATE = 0.08;
const PHONE_PRICE = 99.99;
const ACCESSORY_PRICE = 9.99;

var bank_balance = 303.91;
var amount = 0;
// your code goes here
const SPENDING_THRESHOLD = 200;
const TAX_RATE = 0.08;
const PHONE_PRICE = 99.99;
const ACCESSORY_PRICE = 9.99;
var bank_balance = 303.91;
var amount = 0;
let i=0;
while ( amount < bank_balance ) {
amount = amount + PHONE_PRICE;
if (amount < SPENDING_THRESHOLD) {
amount = amount + ACCESSORY_PRICE;
}
console.log(amount);
}
function calculateTax(amount) {
var amountWithTax = amount + amount*TAX_RATE;
/* console.log(amountWithTax); */
}



```
 â›‘ Answer of the above will `$334.76`.

2. ðŸŽ– Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 20. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is even or odd, and report that to the screen using `alert` (e.g. "2 is even").
```js
// your code goes here
for(let i = 0; i <= 20; i++){
  if(i % 2 === 0){
    console.log("even")
  } else {
    console.log('odd')
  }
}
```
3. ðŸŽ–Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 10. For each iteration of the for loop, it will multiply the number by 9 and log the result in console (e.g. "2 * 9 = 18").
```js
//code
for (let i=0; i<11; i++) {
let table = i * 9;
console.log(table);
}
```
4. ðŸŽ–Use a nested for loop to show the tables for every multiplier from 1 to 10 (100 results total).
(e.g.
"1 * 1 = 1"
"1 * 2 = 2"
"1 * 3 = 3"
"1 * 4 = 4"
.... for all 100 results)
```js
//code
for (let i=0; i<11; i++) {
for (let j=0; j<11; j++)
{
  	let table=i *j;
	console.log(`${i} * ${j} = ${table}`);
}
}
```
5. ðŸŽ–Show the following output using one loop.
```js
// 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
// 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

// Your code goes here
let series="";
let i;
for(i=1;i<=9;i++)
{
  series+= (i!==5) ? i+"," : i+ "\n";
}
series+=i;
console.log(series);
```

6. ðŸŽ–Use a while loop to add up the numbers 1 to 20.
```js
// Your code goes here
var j=0;
for (let i=0;i<=20;i++) {
j = j + i;
console.log(j);
}
```

7. ðŸŽ–Use a while loop to print out the even number from 1 to 20. (You'll need Modulus for this. And an IF Statement.)
```js
// Your code goes here
let i=1;
while(i<=20) 
{
    if(i%2==0)
        console.log(i);
    i++;
}


```
