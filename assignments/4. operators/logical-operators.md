# Logical Operator

1. ðŸ¥‡What's the output of the following, write the output next to the code as comment.

* [ ] Logical AND operation

```js
true  && true; //output 		true
true  && false;				false
false && true;				false
false && false;				false
"foo" && "bar";				"bar"
"bar" && "foo";				"foo"
"foo" && "";				""
""    && "foo";				""
" "   && "John" && "" && false		""
false && "Hey" && undefined		false
"undefined" && false && 42		false
```

* [ ] Logical OR operation
```js
true  || true;				true
true  || false;				true
false || true;				true
false || false;				false
"foo" || "bar";				"foo"
"bar" || "foo";				"bar"
"foo" || "";				"foo"
""    || "foo";				"foo"
" "   || "John" || "" || false		"John"
false || "Hey" || undefined		"Hey"
"undefined" || false || 42		"undefined"
```

2. ðŸ¥ˆYou have two variables i.e `isGuestOneVeg` and  `isGuestTwoVeg` according to the value using logical && and || opeartor do the following.

* [ ] If both are veg "Only offer up vegan dishes."
* [ ] At least one veg  "Make sure to offer up some vegan options."
* [ ] Else, "Offer up anything on the menu"

```js
let isGuestOneVeg = false;
let isGuestTwoVeg = false;
var foodMenu = (isGuestOneVeg && isGuestTwoVeg)?`Only offer up vegan dishes`:(isGuestOneVeg || isGuestTwoVeg)?`Make sure to offer up some vegan options`:`Offer up anything on the menu`;
alert(foodMenu);

```

3. ðŸŽ–Using the variable `temperature` and logical operators do the following
* [ ] If temperature is less then 32 alert "It is freezing outside"
* [ ] If the temperature is greater then 110 alert "It is hot outside"
* [ ] else 'Go for it. It is pretty nice out'
```js
let temperature = 4;
var tempOutside = (temperature < 32) ? `It is freezing outside` : (temperature >110)?`It is hot outside` : `Go for it. It is pretty nice out`;
alert(tempOutside);

```

4. ðŸŽ– Output of this and the reason behind the output.
```js
alert( alert(1) || 2 || alert(3) );
